Every musical artist has a unique style that permeates through their music. The content of their songs often evolves over the course of their career but the original voice is always present. Our goal for this project is to dive into the heart of the artist and see if we are able to bring this voice out. The concrete task we are going to achieve is given a seed set of words, can we construct a new and original song in an artistâ€™s style.
